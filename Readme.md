# Content

This section contains all externally available educational material from Spearbit. The goal of publicizing and creating content like this is to foster and support a community of dedicated researchers consistently motivated to take the next step in their web3 security knowledge and for that material to be just as beneficial to those with heavier experience in the field as it is to juniors.

**Tldr**; We believe in elevating the standard for security research, thus our content will reflect the same.

## Report and Finding Breakdowns

These breakdowns are concise and guided write-ups of findings from some of Spearbit’s top researchers. Study them intently in order to extract the process and perspective of some of the best researchers in the game.
